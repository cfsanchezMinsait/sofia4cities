#Messages for the Tooltips
tooltip_ontologies = A Sofia2 Ontology represents the domain model that a ThinKP uses. Ontologies are defined in JSON format and can represent from a basic model (like a database table) to a complex model with relationships (like a set of related tables). An Ontology Instance is a measure sent by a device (ThinKP). Ontologies can be created in several ways: visually using a UML class diagram, through a JSON or XML schema, field by field or from a Excel/CSV file.
tooltip_clients =A Device (called Knowledge Processor or ThinKP in Sofia2 terminology) represents an element that interacts with the Platform, either publishing or consuming information. A ThinKP can represent from a simple device (like an Arduino board or an iBeacon) to a Gateway (like a Raspberry Pi) to a Business System (like a Java backend). ThinKPs interact with one or more Ontologies. 
tooltip_rules = A Rule allows you to define more complex logic. Rules can be executed on the arrival of an Ontology Instance or with a schedule (CRON-based). Rules can be IF-THEN-ELSE based (Script Rules) or CEP-based (temporal relationships between multiple ontology instances). Rules can be created in different languages (R, Python, groovy) through the web console itself.
tooltip_visualization = Visualization tools allow you to use the information stored in the Platform in a graphic and intuitive way. You can create single visualization elements (Gadgets), merge them into a web page (Dashboard) or even create complex SCADA synoptics representing the evolution of signals (ontology instances).
tooltip_tools = These tools assist you in the operation of the platform.You can view the stored instances of a given ontology, the ThinKPs currently connected to the platform, etc.
tooltip_administration = This menu allows you to manage users, monitor the platform, manage operations, configure security, etc.
tooltip_apiManager = The API Manager creates custom REST APIs to expose the information managed by the platform in a safe way. REST APIs are a standard access interface for mobile applications and external systems, and also provide trouble-free access to the entities managed by the Platform. 
tooltip_socialMedia = The Social Media analysis tools provide access to information of different social networks (Twitter, Facebook, Instagram) and APIs (Google Analytics, Brandwatch). This module supports streaming and scheduled loads, and also exporting the data to Ontologies.
tooltip_analytics=The Platform has multiple analytics capabilities, like the DataFlow engine (allows you to configure sources, destinations and transformations to manipulate data) and the Sofia2 Notebooks (they allow data scientists to apply data transforms and Machine Learning alrgorithms).
tooltip_importExport=This menu allows you to import or export Sofia2 configurations (users, ontologies, etc).

graph.description=This graph represents some of the Sofia2 concepts that have been registered in the platform. If you place the mouse over the main nodes, a particular description will be displayed. When you click on a node, you will be able to see a table with relevant information about it and their particular links will be highlighted.If you also move the mouse by clicking, you can move the node as well as its links. If you want to move the entire position graph, simply click on any part of the graph that does not correspond to a node and move the mouse.
